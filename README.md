### Dengue Cases in Rio Grande do Sul

This repository presents a detailed analysis of dengue cases in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, covering the period from 2015 to 2024. The goal of this study is to uncover trends, patterns, and disparities in dengue incidence across municipalities, providing actionable insights for public health strategies. The analysis includes the following key aspects:

- **Total Cases and Incidence Rates:**  
  - Identification of municipalities with the highest total number of confirmed dengue cases.  
  - Examination of average incidence rates (cases per population), highlighting municipalities with a proportionally higher burden of dengue.  

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  - Porto Alegre, despite having the highest number of total cases, showed a lower incidence rate relative to its population, contrasting with smaller municipalities like Santa Rosa.  
  - Insights were drawn on whether higher incidence reflects better reporting or challenges in disease control.  

- **Seasonal Trends:**  
  - Data was categorized by epidemiological weeks and grouped into seasons (summer, autumn, winter, spring).  
  - Patterns of dengue outbreaks were analyzed to identify seasonal peaks and their implications for public health preparedness.  

- **Visualization and Insights:**  
  - Comprehensive visualizations, including line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps, were created to facilitate a clear understanding of the data trends.  
  - Observations highlight potential areas for intervention and improvement in disease management.
